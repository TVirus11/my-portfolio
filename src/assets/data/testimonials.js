    desc: "Saurav is a professional person, he's hardworking and passionate about his work, I know him since the school days, since from the beginning he was completely different from others, while others would have wasted their time during breaks or games, he was to be found in the School's computer labs, trying to learn something new everyday. I wish him good luck for his career in IT. I believe he will acquire a top notch position in whichever place he goes in future.",
